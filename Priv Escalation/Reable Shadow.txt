The /etc/shadow file contains user password hashes and is usually readable only by the root user.

Note that the /etc/shadow file on the VM is world-readable:

ls -l /etc/shadow

View the contents of the /etc/shadow file:

cat /etc/shadow

Each line of the file represents a user. A user's password hash (if they have one) can be found between the first and second colons (:) of each line.

Save the root user's hash to a file called hash.txt on your Kali VM and use john the ripper to crack it. You may have to unzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz first and run the command using sudo depending on your version of Kali:

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

Switch to the root user, using the cracked password:

su root

The /etc/shadow file contains user password hashes and is usually readable only by the root user.

Note that the /etc/shadow file on the VM is world-writable:

ls -l /etc/shadow

Generate a new password hash with a password of your choice:

mkpasswd -m sha-512 newpasswordhere

Edit the /etc/shadow file and replace the original root user's password hash with the one you just generated.

Switch to the root user, using the new password:

su root
