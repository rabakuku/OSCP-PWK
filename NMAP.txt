Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is a free, open-source tool for vulnerability scanning and network discovery. 
Network administrators use Nmap to identify what devices are running on their systems, 
discovering hosts that are available and the services they offer, finding open ports and detecting security risks.

-----------------------------SIMPLE SCAN----------------------------

1. Nmap Target Selection

Scan a single IP
- nmap 127.0.0.1

Scan a host
- nmap www.ccdtt.com

Scan a range of IPs
- nmap 127.0.0.1-20

Scan a subnet
- nmap 127.0.0.0.0/24

Scan targets from a text file
- nmap -iL list-of-ips.txt

These are all default scans, which will scan 1000 TCP ports. Host discovery will take place.

-----------------------------PORTS SELECTION----------------------------

2. Nmap Port Selection
Scan a single Port
- nmap -p 22 127.0.0.1

Scan a range of ports
- nmap -p 1-100 127.0.0.1

Scan 100 most common ports (Fast)   
- nmap -F 127.0.0.1

Scan all 65535 ports  
- nmap -p- 127.0.0.1

-----------------------------SCAN TYPES----------------------------

3. Nmap Port Scan types
Scan using TCP connect
- nmap -sT 127.0.0.1

Scan using TCP SYN scan (default)
- nmap -sS 127.0.0.1

Scan selected ports - ignore discovery
- nmap -Pn -F 127.0.0.1

Scan UDP ports 
- nmap -sU -p 123,161,162 127.0.0.1

Privileged access is required to perform the default SYN scans. If privileges are insufficient a TCP connect scan will be used. A TCP connect requires a full TCP connection to be established and therefore is a slower scan. Ignoring discovery is often required as many firewalls or hosts will not respond to PING, so could be missed unless you select the -Pn parameter. Of course this can make scan times much longer as you could end up sending scan probes to hosts that are not there.

-----------------------------VERSION DETECIOTN----------------------------

4. Service and OS Detection
Detect OS and Services
- nmap -A 127.0.0.1 

Standard service detection
- nmap -sV 127.0.0.1 

More aggressive Service Detection
- nmap -sV --version-intensity 5 127.0.0.1

Lighter banner grabbing detection 
- nmap -sV --version-intensity 0 127.0.0.1

Service and OS detection rely on different methods to determine the operating system or service running on a particular port.
The more aggressive service detection is often helpful if there are services running on unusual ports.
On the other hand the lighter version of the service will be much faster as it does not really attempt to detect the service simply grabbing the banner of the open service.

-----------------------------OUTPUT TO FILE----------------------------

5. Nmap Output Formats
Save default output to file
- nmap -oN outputfile.txt 127.0.0.1

Save results as XML
- nmap -oX outputfile.xml 127.0.0.1

Save results in a format for grep
- nmap -oG outputfile.txt 127.0.0.1

Save in all formats
- nmap -oA outputfile 127.0.0.1

The default format could also be saved to a file using a simple file redirect command > file. Using the -oN option allows the results to be saved but also can be monitored in the terminal as the scan is under way.

-----------------------------ADVANCED----------------------------------

-----------------------------NSE SCRIPTS ------------------------------

6. Digging deeper with NSE Scripts
Scan using default safe scripts
- nmap -sV -sC 127.0.0.1

Get help for a script
- nmap --script-help=ssl-heartbleed

Scan using a specific NSE script
- nmap -sV -p 443 â€“script=ssl-heartbleed.nse 127.0.0.1

Scan with a set of scripts
- nmap -sV --script=smb* 127.0.0.1

According to my Nmap install there are currently 471 NSE scripts. The scripts are able to perform a wide range of security related testing and discovery functions. If you are serious about your network scanning you really should take the time to get familiar with some of them.

The option --script-help=$scriptname will display help for the individual scripts. To get an easy list of the installed scripts try locate nse | grep script.

You will notice I have used the -sV service detection parameter. Generally most NSE scripts will be more effective and you will get better coverage by including service detection.

-----------------------------IP ENUMERATION----------------------------------

7. Find Information about IP address
- nmap --script=asn-query,whois,ip-geolocation-maxmind 192.168.1.0/24

-----------------------------HTTP SERVICES----------------------------------

8. HTTP Service Information
Gather page titles from HTTP services
- nmap --script=http-title 192.168.1.0/24

Get HTTP headers of web services
- nmap --script=http-headers 192.168.1.0/24

Find web apps from known paths
- nmap --script=http-enum 192.168.1.0/24

There are many HTTP information gathering scripts, here are a few that are simple but helpful when examining larger networks. Helps in quickly identifying what the HTTP service is that is running on the open port. Note the http-enum script is particularly noisy. It is similar to Nikto in that it will attempt to enumerate known paths of web applications and scripts. This will inevitably generated hundreds of 404 HTTP responses in the web server error and access logs.

------------------------------Heartbleed--------------------------------------

9. Detect Heartbleed SSL Vulnerability
- nmap -sV -p 443 --script=ssl-heartbleed 192.168.1.0/24

Heartbleed detection is one of the available SSL scripts. It will detect the presence of the well known Heartbleed vulnerability in SSL services. Specify alternative ports to test SSL on mail and other protocols (Requires Nmap 6.46).
